# Basic Installation and Usage

You can generally install the APIs through `pypi` using pip or directly from git.
<br>
The commands will generally be:

Pypi: `pip install <api_name>` # The API name will be the same name as the repository!
<br>Git:  `pip install git+https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/<repository_name>.git` 

This will automatically install the package and all of its dependencies.

Compatibility:
<br>All my APIs should support `Python3.7 - 3.12+`
