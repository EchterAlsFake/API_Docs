# Installation

Installation from `Pypi`:

$ `pip install missAV_api`

Or Install directly from `GitHub`

`pip install git+https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/missAV_api`

> [!NOTE]
> Installing from git may cause issues as I am not separating the master branch
> from commits which could break thing unexpectedly!

## Client

```python
from missav_api import Client
client = Client()

# If you want to apply a custom configuration for the BaseCore class, here you go:  
# You don't have to do that, it's only if you want to change the configuration of eaf_base_api!
from base_api.modules.config import config
from base_api.base import BaseCore

# Change the values you like e.g.,
config.request_delay = 10

# Apply the configuration
core = BaseCore(config=config)
core.enable_logging() # .... if you want to enable logging
core.enable_kill_switch() # ... if you want to enable kill switch
client = Client(core)
# New client object with your custom configuration applied
```

> [!NOTE]
> The client handles everything, and you should **ALWAYS** import and set it up!

### Get a video object

```python
from missav_api import Client
video = Client().get_video(url="<video_url>")
```

| Attribute     | Returns | is cached? |
|:--------------|:-------:|:----------:|
| .title        |   str   |    Yes     |
| .publish_date |   str   |    Yes     |
| .video_code   |   str   |    Yes     |

### Download a video

```python
from missav_api import Client
from base_api.modules.progress_bars import Callback
client = Client()
video = client.get_video("<video_url>")
quality = "best" 
video.download(quality=quality, path="./", downloader="threaded")

# You can define your own callback function with custom progress reporting using:
def custom_callback(downloaded, total):
    """This is an example of how you can implement the custom callback"""

    percentage = (downloaded / total) * 100
    print(f"Downloaded: {downloaded} / {total} segments ({percentage:.2f}%)")
```

| Argument   | Description                                  | possible values                         |

| downloader | The download mode of the video               | `threaded` `FFMPEG` `default`           |
| path       | The output path of the video                 | Any `str` object                        |
| callback   | Custom callback function                     | Any function with (pos,total) structure |
| no_title   | The title will not be included into the path | `True` `False`                          |

# Proxy Support
Proxy support is NOT implemented in hqporner_api itself, but in its underlying network component: `eaf_base_api`
<br>Please see [Base API Configuration](https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/API_Docs/blob/master/Porn_APIs/eaf_base_api.md) to enable proxies

# Caching
All network requests (UTF-8 responses) are cached inside the base_api.
If you want to configure this behavior, please see:
<br>https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/API_Docs/blob/master/Porn_APIs/eaf_base_api.md

Most objects such as the `Video` attributes are cached, meaning that if you
fetch the same video once again, your system will automatically display the cached
values and won't newly fetch everything.

You can see if an object is cached when at the top of the function name, there is a
`cached_property` decorator (in the code)
