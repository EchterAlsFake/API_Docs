# What's this? 
This repository serves as a public documentation of all my projects. This includes complex API / Python package documentation,
and also code explanation and detailed information about the structure of other heavier projects. If you want to use any
of my APIs or you want to contribute to other projects from me I would recommend you to read through it, because it could
help you a lot.

The thing I most hate is complex undocumented software.

# Maintaining / Updating
I will update the documentations and add more things from time to time.
Maybe when I am in school and a subject unexpectedly got stand out.

> [!NOTE]
> The `requirements.txt` file has dependencies, but you don't need them.
> It's only for my IDE, so that it doesn't show me thousands of errors
> in the READMEs.

# Contributions / Issues
I don't want you to write any docs for me. If you want to help, you can search for grammar issues and fix them.
That would also be very helpful for me.

If you need something documented more specifically, you can create
an issue and ask about it.
